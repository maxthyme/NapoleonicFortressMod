I ache, must I continue this mockery of a life?
Many have tried to end me, perhaps you will succeed where they did not?
I can hear the blood coursing through your veins, it is like a pounding in my skull!
Have you come to bring my wretched existence to a close?
Why do we fight? The release of death beckons so sweetly, yet this cursed flesh desperately resists!
The throbbing behind my eyes worsens. Is it that terrible racket coming from your body? If you would just stop moving, perhaps... it would... cease!
One of us must fall, if you are strong enough, perhaps I will finally be able to rest?
Come to me, warrior, let us determine who had the better creator!
Do not take it personally, my flesh hates all flesh. My mind hates only the meat which imprisons me.
