Try to add things that fit the victorian-era and remove/change anything you feel like it doesn't fit in it. If you find any bug/unbalanced stuff, feel free to whine about it on the thread (Or the Bay12 forum if I already uploaded it there)

Please don't add any tileset or secondary mod or anything, I want everything except for the raws (and the audio files) to be like Vanilla to avoid the mod from not working with other mods if the user desires to mix mods in case this one gets outdated.

Also, feel free to add yourself to the CREDITS File if you did a change and you feel like getting your name to appear here (You narcicist bastard)

So far, we need more weapons, a way to add cannons, more words for the languages and a windows version (You can still just copy the raws and data files into your windows copy of Dorf Fortress if you don't have a Linux computer)

Thanks for reading!
